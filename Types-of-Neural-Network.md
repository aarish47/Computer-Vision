- A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, also known as neurons, organized into layers. 

- Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, and the network learns by adjusting these weights based on input data. Neural networks are widely used in machine learning for tasks such as **pattern recognition, classification, regression, and more.**

> # **Types of Neural network**

> 1. **Standard Neural network (SNN)**
 - The simplest type of neural network.
 - there is no cycles or loops in the network structure.

> 2. **Convolutional Neural network (CNN)**

 - Designed for tasks related to image and video analysis.
 - Utilizes convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.
- Commonly used in image classification, object detection, and image recognition.

> 3. **Recurrent Neural network (RNN)**

 - Suitable for sequence data and tasks where context or temporal dependencies matter.
- Neurons have connections that create cycles, allowing information to persist.
- Widely used in natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series analysis.

# **Computer-Vision**
Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field that enables computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. It involves the development of algorithms and systems that allow machines to interpret and analyze visual information similarly to the way humans do. The goal is to teach computers to recognize patterns, understand scenes, and make decisions based on visual input.
